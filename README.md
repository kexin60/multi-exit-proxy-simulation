# Modules
- Proxy_Reachability_Testing [test_proxies.py](test_proxies.py)     
This module implements a concurrent proxy reachability testing tool for Clash-style configurations.  
It parses proxy lists, performs TCP connectivity checks, and filters unreachable nodes efficiently.  
The script supports parallel execution and outputs structured JSON reports for further analysis.

- Multi_Exit_Routing_Simulation     
Simple Version [double_ip_simple.py](double_ip_simple.py)   
A lightweight implementation designed for quick proxy validation and IP checking.
It focuses on reliability and minimal configuration, making it suitable for basic network testing scenarios.  
Advanced Version [double_ip_advanced.py](double_ip_advanced.py)     
An extended version with enhanced browser automation capabilities, including:  
Browser fingerprint randomization (User-Agent, viewport, timezone)  
Persistent session management (per-port profiles)  
Anti-detection techniques (stealth mode, script injection)  
Human behavior simulation (mouse movement, scrolling, typing patterns)  
Flexible execution modes (incognito, deep-stealth, text-only loading)  
This version is designed for more complex scenarios such as automation under detection constraints, multi-session simulation, and realistic browsing behavior emulation.  

# Core Framework
- Sing-box Configuration [config.json](config.json)    
This configuration defines multiple inbound proxy ports and maps them to different outbound nodes.  
It enables local multi-port routing and serves as the foundation for multi-exit simulation experiments.

# Data & Results
This project performs proxy connectivity testing across multiple nodes and regions.
Key observations:
- A significant portion of proxy nodes are reachable via TCP connectivity checks
- Proxy reliability varies across different regions
- The testing framework effectively filters unstable or unreachable nodes
Raw outputs are generated automatically by the testing scripts.

# External Dependencies & Credits

- sing-box (Proxy Engine)
This project builds upon the open-source sing-box framework, which provides the underlying proxy routing capabilities.

- Public Proxy Nodes (Testing Data Source)
Proxy nodes used in this project are sourced from publicly available repositories for testing and experimentation purposes.

# Notes
- This project focuses on system integration and network experimentation rather than proxy implementation itself.  
- Users are expected to provide their own proxy configurations if needed.
